# Huffman-coding
**description:** 
The Huffman coding algorithm is a lossless compression algorithm that uses frequency of characters to reduce the size of the file.

Programming language used for implementation: Java
Data structures : Minheap
Visualization : graphviz
Time Complexities: n is the length of the inputted string
Encoding : O(n)
Decoding: O(n^2)
